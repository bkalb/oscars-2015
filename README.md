The academy awards were last night, but you probably missed checking the website! The problem is that it's somewhat difficult to get through. You've been hired as the designer. 

**fork the repository,** then get to work by doing the following:

1. Apply consistency and clarity. Remove 
2. Apply color and contrast. Right now, it's hard to know where to look. Try reducing colors and only using one or two to draw the user's eye where you want it to go.
3. Apply hierarchy and typography. Move things in the right order so that they make sense. Style headlines in a way that leads the users eye down the page. Use font sizes that help give the page a sense of order.
