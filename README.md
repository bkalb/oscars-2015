The academy awards were last night. Maybe you saw the show, but you might have missed the website. The academy realized there were some usability issues, so they're looking for a designer to help them out.

Here's where you come in:

**fork the repository,** then get to work by doing the following:

1. Apply consistency and clarity. Remove all extraneous boxes and conflicting styles.
2. Apply color and contrast. Right now, it's hard to know where to look. Try reducing colors and only using one or two to draw the user's eye where you want it to go.
3. Apply hierarchy and typography. Move things in the right order so that they make sense. Style headlines in a way that leads the users eye down the page. Use font sizes that help give the page a sense of order.
